# Claude Code Toolkit

A collection of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills, a global CLAUDE.md, and a project template for GitHub issue management, PR workflows, and development utilities.

## Philosophy

This toolkit separates concerns into four layers:

- **Skills** define **procedures** — the steps to follow when performing a task (e.g., how to implement an issue, how to decompose work)
- **Agents** define **constrained roles** — specialized sub-agents with restricted tool access for specific domains (e.g., read-only infrastructure analysis, deployment-scoped automation)
- **Rules** define **contextual policies** — standards that load only when relevant files are being edited (e.g., test quality rules load only for test files, documentation standards only for .md files)
- **CLAUDE.md** defines **global policies** — the standards and conventions that apply to every conversation (e.g., permission workarounds, code quality, communication preferences)

Rules keep the global CLAUDE.md lean by moving context-specific instructions out of the always-loaded file. Skills and agents reference policies from CLAUDE.md and rules rather than duplicating them.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanKeijzer/claude-code-toolkit.git ~/Projects/claude-code-toolkit
cd ~/Projects/claude-code-toolkit
./install.sh
```

This creates five symlinks and copies one file:
- `~/.claude/skills` → `skills/` (all skills auto-discovered)
- `~/.claude/agents` → `agents/` (sub-agents auto-discovered)
- `~/.claude/bin` → `bin/` (helper scripts)
- `~/.claude/rules` → `rules/` (contextual rules, loaded based on file patterns)
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → `claude-md/global.md` (global policies)
- `~/.claude/settings.json` ← copied from `claude-md/settings-global.jsonc` (global permissions)

The settings file is copied (not symlinked) because Claude Code writes to it when you approve permissions during a session. Restart Claude Code after installation.

Skills are auto-discovered from `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Agents are auto-discovered from `~/.claude/agents/*.md`.

### Project Template

To set up a new project with a CLAUDE.md and settings:

```bash
# Project-specific policies
cp ~/Projects/claude-code-toolkit/claude-md/project-template.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md

# Project-specific permissions (remove comments and keep what applies)
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude
cp ~/Projects/claude-code-toolkit/claude-md/settings-template.jsonc /path/to/your/project/.claude/settings.json
```

Then fill in the sections relevant to your project. The settings template includes commented-out permissions for common tools (Docker, Python, Node, etc.) — uncomment what you need.

## Sub-Agents

The toolkit includes specialized sub-agents for issue creation, infrastructure management, and deployment. They work together with a clear separation of concerns:

```
Rough idea → issue-crafter → Well-defined issues → /decompose (if large) → /implement or /implement-epic
                  ↑                                                             ↓
         /refine (existing issues)                                      devops-automator (deploy)
                                                                             ↑
infra-maintainer (advises) → GitHub issue → /implement (code) ───────────────┘
                                           ↑
                              or: human creates issue directly
```

| Agent | Role | Tools | Model |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| `issue-crafter` | Translates rough ideas into well-structured GitHub issues. Asks clarifying questions, proposes issues for approval, then creates them. | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write | Sonnet |
| `infra-maintainer` | Read-only infrastructure advisor. Analyzes, diagnoses, and recommends — never makes direct changes. | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (diagnostics only) | Sonnet |
| `devops-automator` | Deployment engineer. The only path to production — always through the pipeline. | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash | Sonnet |

### issue-crafter

Translates rough ideas and descriptions into well-structured GitHub issues. Explores the codebase for context, asks clarifying questions about scope and acceptance criteria, and presents structured proposals for approval before creating anything. Recommends `/decompose` for issues that are too large for a single PR.

**Workflow (create):** rough idea → codebase exploration → clarifying questions → issue proposal → human approval → `gh issue create`
**Workflow (refine):** existing issue → read & assess → interactive Q&A → updated proposal → human approval → `gh issue edit`

The `/refine` skill provides a shortcut to invoke the refine workflow for a specific issue.

### infra-maintainer

Infrastructure advisor for self-managed VPS servers. Operates in **read-only** mode (no Write/Edit tools). Runs diagnostic commands, assesses risks, and proposes improvements as GitHub issues (with `proposal` + `infra` labels) — but only after human confirmation.

**Analysis domains:** server hardening, reverse proxy & SSL, backup & disaster recovery, monitoring & uptime, Docker management, security updates & vulnerability management.

### devops-automator

Deployment engineer responsible for CI/CD pipelines and the path to production. Every change follows the same path: branch → test → PR → review → merge → deploy. No exceptions.

**Scope:** GitHub Actions workflows, deployment strategies (lightweight restart vs. full rebuild), Docker image management, environment & secret management, branch protection rules.

### Why no "software engineer" agent?

Agents are valuable because of their **constraints**: infra-maintainer is read-only, devops-automator is deployment-scoped. A "software engineer" agent would need all tools with no specific restrictions — that's just Claude Code itself. The `/implement` skill already encapsulates the full workflow: issue → branch → code + tests → PR.

## Helper Scripts

The `bin/` directory contains reusable shell scripts that skills call instead of using inline `for` loops.

**Why?** Claude Code permissions match on the **first word** of a Bash command. An inline loop like `for issue in 15 16 17; do gh issue view $issue ...; done` gets blocked because the first word is `for`, not `gh`. By wrapping batch operations in scripts, permissions can match on the script path (`~/.claude/bin/*`).

## Configuration Files

### Global Settings (`claude-md/settings-global.jsonc`)

Copied to `~/.claude/settings.json` by install.sh. Pre-configures permissions so Claude Code can work without constant approval prompts:

- **File operations** — Write, Edit, MultiEdit (always needed)
- **Shell utilities** — cat, grep, find, ls, etc. (read-only, low risk)
- **File management** — mkdir, cp, mv, chmod (project scaffolding)
- **Git & GitHub** — git, gh (with destructive operations caught by hook)
- **Docker** — docker commands
- **Node.js** — npm, npx
- **Python** — python, ruff, uv, source
- **Toolkit** — helper scripts from `~/.claude/bin/`

This is a copy (not symlink) because Claude Code writes to it when you approve permissions during a session.

### Hooks (`settings-global.jsonc` → `~/.claude/settings.json`)

The global settings include two `PreToolUse` hooks that run **in all permission modes**, including bypass-permissions:

1. **`hook-auto-approve-bash.sh`** — Auto-approves safe compound commands that permission matching would otherwise block (shell redirects to `/tmp/`, pipes to `jq`/`head`/`tail`, `&&` chains of allowed commands, `for` loops around `gh`/`git`). This solves the first-word matching problem for complex commands.

2. **`hook-block-destructive.sh`** — Blocks destructive patterns: `rm -rf /`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `git clean -f`, `dd if=... of=/dev/`, and more. When blocked, Claude sees the reason and adjusts its approach.

To use bypass-permissions mode with these safety nets:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "your task here"
```

### Global CLAUDE.md (`claude-md/global.md`)

Symlinked to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, applies to all projects. Contains only what's needed in every conversation:

- **General Preferences** — language and communication conventions
- **Bash Permissies** — permission matching rules for venv and wrapper scripts
- **Code Quality** — verification-before-coding rules
- **Available Utilities** — references to wrapper scripts and audit skills
- **Claude Code Workarounds** — native tool preferences, file writing rules

Contextual rules live in `rules/` and load based on their frontmatter: some always (error handling, API design, data integrity, structured logging, code review), others only when relevant files are edited (testing, documentation).

### Rules (`rules/`)

Rules provide contextual policies that load based on frontmatter configuration. Always-loaded rules apply to every conversation; path-triggered rules load only when matching files are being edited.

| Rule | Loads | What it enforces |
|------|-------|------------------|
| `error-handling.md` | Always | Never swallow errors, add context when propagating, translate at boundaries, RFC 9457 Problem Details |
| `api-design.md` | Always | Standard HTTP status codes, RFC 9457 errors, cursor-based pagination, rate limiting headers |
| `data-integrity.md` | Always | Transactions, DB constraints, idempotency, race condition prevention, expand-contract migrations |
| `structured-logging.md` | Always | Structured key-value pairs, consistent field names, severity levels, never log secrets |
| `code-review.md` | Always | No performative agreement, verify before implementing, push back when feedback is wrong |
| `testing.md` | Test files | Real behavior over mocks, 5 test scenarios per feature, realistic fixtures |
| `documentation.md` | .md files | Current purpose over history, usage guidance, no changelogs |

### Project Template (`claude-md/project-template.md`)

Copy to a project root as `CLAUDE.md` and fill in:

- Project overview, tech stack, project structure
- Development commands (run, test, lint, validate)
- API and database conventions
- Project-specific patterns and deployment notes

### Settings Template (`claude-md/settings-template.jsonc`)

Copy to `.claude/settings.json` in your project. Contains commented-out permissions for common tools (Docker, Python, Node, project scripts) and safe deny-defaults for destructive git operations. Uncomment what applies to your project.

Global permissions (git, gh, edit, file operations) are in `~/.claude/settings.json` — don't repeat them in project settings.

## Knowledge Capture

Two skills work together to prevent knowledge loss across sessions:

- `/retro` captures knowledge from any working session — debug, implementation, configuration, deployment — as project-local artefacts (scripts, CLAUDE.md procedures, design decisions, auto-memory entries). Findings that look reusable across projects are flagged as toolkit candidates.
- `/promote` generalises a project-local script or procedure into the shared toolkit, leaving a thin wrapper in the original project.

The rule: capture locally first, promote when you have seen the pattern twice.

## Multi-Device Sync

For use across multiple devices (laptop, servers, cloud sandboxes):

1. Run `install.sh` on the first device (creates symlinks + `toolkit.yaml`)
2. On additional devices, use `/sync-toolkit pull` to install from configured sources
3. Use `/sync-toolkit drift` to check for local modifications

Configuration lives in `~/.claude/toolkit.yaml`. Add private repos there for proprietary skills.

---

## Skills in Detail

### 1. `/refine` - Refine Issue

**When:** You have a rough issue that needs sharper scope and acceptance criteria. Use on the parent issue before `/decompose`, then on each sub-issue after. Every refine pass makes the issue more concrete and catches gaps early.

**What it does:**
1. Reads the existing issue and explores the codebase for context
2. Asks focused questions in rounds of 2-4 to clarify scope, criteria, and dependencies
3. Proposes an updated issue body with clear structure
4. Updates the issue after confirmation

**Syntax:**
```bash
/refine 42
```

**Example output:**
```
Reading issue #42: Add invoice attachment storage...

Current issue is missing:
- Specific acceptance criteria
- Scope boundaries (which file types? size limits?)
- Storage strategy

Questions:
1. Should attachments be stored on local disk or S3?
2. What file types need to be supported?
3. Is there a maximum file size?

[... Q&A rounds until sharp ...]

Proposed updated issue: [full body with Context, Scope, Acceptance Criteria]
Update issue #42 with this? (y/n)

### 2. `/decompose` - Break Down Issue

**When:** You have a large issue that's too complex for a single PR.

**What it does:**
1. Fetches issue and analyzes its structure
2. Proposes sub-issues based on phases/tasks
3. Creates a draft tracking PR
4. Creates sub-issues (after confirmation)
5. Adds all `Closes #XXX` statements

**Syntax:**
```bash
/decompose 723
```

**Example output:**
```
Analyzing issue #723: Stripe Payment Provider

Proposed breakdown:
| # | Sub-Issue | Scope |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Phase 1: Abstraction Layer | Backend |
| 2 | Phase 2: Stripe Integration | Backend |
| 3 | Phase 3: Frontend Updates | Frontend |

Create draft PR and sub-issues? (A/B/C)
```

---

### 3. `/implement-epic` - Implement All Sub-Issues

**When:** You've decomposed an epic into sub-issues and want to implement them all automatically.

**What it does:**
1. Reads the parent issue and parses sub-issues with dependencies
2. Groups sub-issues into waves (dependency order)
3. Per sub-issue: branch, implement, test, PR, auto-merge
4. On failure: creates bug issue, skips dependent issues, continues
5. Runs runtime verification (container health, API smoke test, migrations, browser)
6. Updates tracking PR after each sub-issue

**Syntax:**
```bash
/implement-epic 723
```

**Workflow position:**
```
/refine → /decompose → /refine (per sub-issue) → /implement-epic → tracking PR (manual merge to develop)
```

**Difference from /implement:**

| Aspect | /implement | /implement-epic |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Scope | Single issue | All sub-issues of an epic |
| Confirmation | Stops for plan approval | Runs autonomously |
| PRs | One PR against base branch | One PR per sub-issue against feature branch |
| Failure | Stops on failure | Creates bug issue, skips dependents, continues |
| Verification | CLAUDE.md pattern-based (only when Docker files changed) | Always runs full verification |

---

### 4. `/extend` - Add More Sub-Issues

**When:** You've completed the first batch of sub-issues and want to tackle the next phase.

**What it does:**
1. Finds existing tracking PR
2. Analyzes which tasks don't have sub-issues yet
3. Proposes new sub-issues
4. Adds to tracking PR

**Syntax:**
```bash
/extend 723                   # Decompose new sub-issues for remaining tasks
/extend                       # Detect parent from branch
/extend add #1042 to #723     # Add existing issue to tracking PR
/extend add #1042 #1043       # Add multiple issues (parent from branch)
```

**Difference from /decompose:**

| Aspect | /decompose | /extend |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Creates PR | Yes (new) | No (updates existing) |
| Focus | Everything | Only remaining tasks |

---

### 5. `/bug` - Create Bug Issue

**When:** You find a bug while working on a sub-issue, or want to add an existing issue to a tracking PR.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a bug sub-issue (interactively or with title) linked to the parent
2. Or adds an existing issue to the tracking PR
3. Updates `Closes #XXX` statements

**Syntax:**
```bash
/bug                                     # Interactive mode — gathers context first
/bug "Webhook signature fails"           # Create with title, parent from branch
/bug 724 "Webhook signature fails"       # Create with explicit parent #724
/bug add #1042                           # Add existing issue to tracking PR
/bug add #1042 to #723                   # Add with explicit parent
```

**Example:**
```
$ git branch
issue-724-stripe-webhook

$ /bug "Signature verification fails in test mode"

✅ Created: #730 - 🐛 [Parent #724] Bug: Signature verification fails
✅ Added to tracking PR #727
✅ Will auto-close on merge
```

---

### 6. `/update-tracking` - Update Status

**When:** You want to update the progress in the tracking PR.

**What it does:**
1. Checks status of all sub-issues
2. Finds merged PRs
3. Updates the status table
4. Calculates progress percentage

**Syntax:**
```bash
/update-tracking 727
```

**Status indicators:**
| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⏳ | Pending - not started |
| 🔄 | In Progress - has open PR |
| ✅ | Complete - issue closed |
| ❌ | Blocked |
| 🎉 | 100% done |

---

### 7. `/sync-closes` - Sync Closes Statements

**When:** Before merging, to ensure all issues will auto-close.

**What it does:**
1. Finds all sub-issues in tracking table
2. Compares with `Closes #XXX` statements
3. Adds missing ones

**Syntax:**
```bash
/sync-closes 727
```

**Example:**
```
Current Closes: #723, #724, #725
Found in table: #723, #724, #725, #730 (bug)

Missing: #730

Add "Closes #730" to PR? (y/n)
```

---

### 8. `/verify` - Runtime Verification

**When:** After implementation, after Docker changes, or whenever you want to check if the application is actually running correctly.

**What it does:**
1. **Container Health** — checks all Docker containers are running, healthy, not restart-looping, no errors in logs
2. **API Health** — hits health endpoints and key API routes, checks for 5xx errors
3. **Migration Status** — verifies alembic migrations are current (current == head)
4. **Browser Smoke Test** — navigates to frontend via Playwright MCP, takes screenshot, checks console errors

**Syntax:**
```bash
/verify              # quick mode (layers 1-3)
/verify quick        # same as above
/verify full         # all 4 layers including browser
/verify browser      # browser smoke test only
```

**Project configuration:** Add an `Integration Verification` section to your project's CLAUDE.md to configure URLs, container prefixes, health tokens, and trigger patterns. See the project template for the format.

**Example output:**
```
## Verification Report

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Containers | PASS | 5/5 healthy |
| API Health | PASS | 200 OK, all components healthy |
| Migrations | PASS | Current matches head |
| Browser | WARN | 2 console warnings (non-critical) |

Overall: PASS
```

## Complete Example Workflow

### Step 0: Refine the rough issue

```bash
# Issue #723 exists but is vague: "Add Stripe payments"
/refine 723

# Output:
# Reading issue #723...
# Questions about scope, payment methods, error handling...
# [Q&A rounds]
# ✅ Updated issue #723 with clear scope and acceptance criteria
```

### Step 1: Decompose the refined issue

```bash
# Issue #723: Stripe Payment Provider (now well-defined, 5 phases)
/decompose 723

# Output:
# ✅ Created draft PR #727
# ✅ Created sub-issues: #724, #725, #726
# ✅ Progress: 0/3 (0%)
```

### Step 1b: Refine each sub-issue

```bash
# Each sub-issue benefits from a refine pass — sharpens scope and catches gaps
/refine 724
/refine 725
/refine 726

# Output per issue:
# Questions about edge cases, error handling, specific acceptance criteria...
# [Q&A rounds]
# ✅ Updated issue with concrete scope and testable criteria
```

### Step 2: Implement all sub-issues (automated)

```bash
# Option A: Implement all sub-issues automatically
/implement-epic 723

# Output:
# Wave 1: #724 (no deps)
# Wave 2: #725 (depends on #724), #726 (depends on #724)
#
# Implementing #724... ✅ PR #731 merged
# Implementing #725... ✅ PR #732 merged
# Implementing #726... ❌ Failed → bug #730 created
#
# Results: 2/3 complete, 1 bug created

# Option B: Implement sub-issues manually one by one
/implement 724
/implement 725
```

### Step 3: Bug found!

```bash
# On branch issue-724-abstraction-layer
/bug "Factory pattern doesn't work with async"

# Output:
# ✅ Created #730 - 🐛 Bug: Factory pattern doesn't work
# ✅ Added to PR #727
```

### Step 4: Update progress

```bash
/update-tracking 727

# Output:
# #724 - Abstraction: ⏳ → ✅ (PR #731 merged)
# #725 - Stripe: ⏳ → 🔄 (PR #732 open)
# #730 - Bug: ⏳ → ✅ (fixed in #731)
# Progress: 2/4 (50%)
```

### Step 5: Add next phase

```bash
/extend 723

# Output:
# Existing: #724 ✅, #725 🔄, #726 ⏳, #730 ✅
# Remaining tasks: Phase 4 (Frontend), Phase 5 (Testing)
#
# Create #733, #734? (y/n)
```

### Step 6: Sync before merge

```bash
/sync-closes 727

# Output:
# All 7 issues have Closes statements ✅
# Ready to merge!
```

### Step 7: Merge

```bash
# Merge PR #727 → develop
# Auto-closes: #723, #724, #725, #726, #730, #733, #734
```

## Tips

1. **Refine early, refine often**: Run `/refine` on the parent issue before decomposing, then on each sub-issue after. Every pass sharpens scope and catches gaps
2. **Start small**: Decompose into 3-5 sub-issues first, extend later
3. **Update regularly**: Run `/update-tracking` after each merge
4. **Sync before merge**: Always `/sync-closes` before final merge
5. **Branch naming**: Use `issue-XXX-description` for auto-detection
6. **Inline bugs**: Fix small bugs in current branch, only create issues for larger bugs
